# ReverseSnowFlake

I made changes to https://sourceforge.net/projects/revj/ distribution. I have updated the code to work with Python 3.7.3. I have made changes to PyParsing as well. 
You will need:
1. latest version GraphViz installation on windows.
2. Python 3.7.3

Just download the code from here and run "python gui.py" and reverse engineer SQL queries.
